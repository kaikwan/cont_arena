# CONT ARENA: Robot ARENAs for CONTinuous robot learning
This repository contains 3D models that I designed when working at the UW-Amazon Science Hub for miscellanious projects. \
Most of these are designed for continuous robot learning setups - as my contribution to the [WEIRDLab](https://weirdlab.cs.washington.edu/) led by Prof. Abhishek Gupta.

There are 2 models available for public currently:
1. Franka Arm Arena
This 3D model is deployed in the UW CSE Robotics Lab for continuous robot learning done with the Franka Emika Panda robot arm.

2. Realsense Mount for Hello Robot Stretch 2
This 3D model was used for data collection for self-improving robotic systems deployed in real world environments, such as MEDAL++.

4. Weighted object
This rectangular prism is designed to have adjustible mass distribution. It was used for a System Identification Project.
