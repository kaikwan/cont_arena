# CONT ARENA: Robot ARENAs for CONTinuous robot learning
This repository contains 3D models that I designed when working at the UW-Amazon Science Hub for miscellanious projects. \
Most of these are designed for continuous robot learning setups - as my contribution to the [WEIRDLab](https://weirdlab.cs.washington.edu/) by Prof. Abhishek Gupta.
